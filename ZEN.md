# The Zen of Workman

## Core Principles

**It works on day zero.**  
No setup, no configuration, no "getting started" guide. If it doesn't work immediately, it's broken.

**One way to do things.**  
One build system, one package manager, one test framework. Consistency over flexibility. Boring is good.

**The toolchain is the language.**  
LSP, debugger, profiler, formatter - not optional extras. If the tools don't work, the language doesn't work.

**Better tools mean more motivation.**  
Instant feedback loops keep you in flow. Fast builds mean more iterations. Joy in the tools equals joy in the work.

**Nothing gets in the way of progress.**  
No waiting for builds. No fighting the compiler over trivialities. No "works on my machine." Remove friction, add velocity.

**Hard doesn't mean impossible.**  
Systems programming should be accessible. Type safety shouldn't require a PhD. Low-level control when you need it, high-level abstractions when you don't.

**Refactoring legacy should not be scary.**  
Strong types catch breaking changes. Rename works across the codebase. Confidence to change anything.

**Do less if that's enough.**  
Simple solutions over clever ones. Ship working code over perfect code. Complexity is a last resort.

**A good tool is universal.**  
Same language for CLI, GUI, web, embedded. Learn once, use everywhere.

## What We Reject

**❌ "It's not ready yet"** - Ship early, iterate fast.

**❌ "Read the docs"** - Tools should be self-explanatory.

**❌ "That's not how we do it"** - Question everything, keep what works.

**❌ "It works on Unix"** - Cross-platform or it doesn't exist.

**❌ "You're holding it wrong"** - If users struggle, the tool is broken.

**❌ "Just use a different tool"** - One toolchain, no alternatives needed.

**❌ "That's a research problem"** - Practical solutions over theoretical purity.

**❌ "It's fast enough"** - Every second matters.

**❌ "Advanced users can..."** - Design for beginners, scale to experts.

## The Promise

**To developers:**  
Your time is valuable - we won't waste it.  
Your work is important - we won't break it.  
Your platform matters - we support it.  
Your feedback counts - we listen.

**To the language:**  
Stability over features.  
Clarity over cleverness.  
Usability over purity.  
Shipping over perfection.

**To the ecosystem:**  
Open source, open governance.  
No corporate capture.  
Community-driven, not committee-driven.  
Built by developers, for developers.

## Success Metrics

**We succeed when:**
- A beginner ships their first app in a day
- An expert doesn't fight the tools
- Windows users don't feel second-class
- Refactoring is routine, not risky
- Build times are measured in seconds
- The LSP never crashes
- Dependencies just work
- Debugging is straightforward
- The community is welcoming

**We fail when:**
- "It works on my machine"
- "Just wait for the build"
- "Read the 500-page manual"
- "That's a known issue"
- "Use this workaround"
- "It's not supported on Windows"
- "You need to understand X first"

## The Name

**Workman** - Someone who shows up, does the work, ships the product.

Not an artist, not an engineer, not a hacker - a builder.

Practical. Reliable. Unpretentious.
